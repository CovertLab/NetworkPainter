TODO
======================
- movie export
  - open source video capture solution
  - sharp ffmeg
    - http://www.bytescout.com/ffmpegscout_avi_to_swf.html
  - make compatible with apache as service -- possibly give people application and instructions to
    convert to video on their local machine?
  - make into gui app
    - select swf file
	- file if swf supports external interface
	- resize swf
	- combobox to select format
- hide passwords

BUGS
======================


feature discussion
======================
- do we need exportMaxAnimationLoops, exportAnimationFrameRate?
- usePreloader="false" with exported animation?
- viewer always in "fullscreenmode"?
- CytoBank/Experiment features
	- how do ratio, fold change differ?
	- how to allow user to specify control value calculation
	- additional colormaps?
	- what color to display unobserved elements, NaN's?
	- do we need improved charts?
		- log scale  
		- automatic axis scaling
		- histogram	
	- controls for clustering/leaf ordering?
		- distance metric (euclidean, city block, hamming, etc.)
		- linkage (single, complete, average)
		- use optimal leaf ordering
	- What preloaded networks would be useful?
	- authentication/security

future features
=====================
- additional shapes
  - rod
- more complete style control
  - animation alpha
  - edge color, weight
  - font family, size, color
  - label offset
  - second gradient color in membrane, biomolecule, phospholipid gradient fills and strokes
- move all bin/services to /services
  - auto layout (move to /services/AMFPHP/services/GraphViz)
  - compile animation (move to /services/NetworkAnalyzer)
  - svg rasterizes (move to /services/inkscape)
  - getVars
  - endSession
- evidence/reference management
- bayesian inference, NCA

architecture discussion
======================
- network, experiment classes?
- remove animation from diagram class?
- database service?, integrate network and experiment managers?
